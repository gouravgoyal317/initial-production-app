## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses Jenkins to implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

### Pipeline Flow:
GitHub → Jenkins → Docker Build → Container Deployment → AWS EC2

Any code pushed to GitHub automatically triggers the Jenkins pipeline, which builds a new Docker image and deploys the updated application.
